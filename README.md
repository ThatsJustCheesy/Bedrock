# Bedrock
## No more rabbit holes.

Bedrock is a simple browser extension that obscures links on webpages. This discourages [rabbit holing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki_rabbit_hole) on Wikipedia, news articles, and similar sites sprinkled with links.

## Availability
Bedrock is currently implemented as a Chromium extension. It works on at least Google Chrome and Brave Browser.
